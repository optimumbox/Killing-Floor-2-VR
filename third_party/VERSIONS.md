# Dependency pins

Place SDK checkouts under third_party/; they are fetched separately and retain
upstream licences. The adapter uses OpenXR. OpenVR is optional for xrprobe.

| Component | Pin | Upstream |
| --- | --- | --- |
| OpenXR-SDK | release-1.1.63, f2448a8 | https://github.com/KhronosGroup/OpenXR-SDK |
| OpenVR | v2.15.6, 0924064 | https://github.com/ValveSoftware/openvr |
| NVIDIA DLSS (NGX) SDK | v310.7.0, a291cc7; nvngx_dlss.dll SHA-256 BE6E434A...6EE6E (`tools/fetch-ngx.ps1`) | https://github.com/NVIDIA/DLSS |
| CPython portable player runtime | 3.14.3; archive SHA-256 in tools/dependency-pins.json | https://www.python.org/ |

The build uses OpenXR-SDK with pre-generated headers, not OpenXR-SDK-Source.
`tools/prepare_art_dependencies.py` fetches its exact full commit and the pinned
SourceIO/PSK/UModel tools in `tools/art-dependency-pins.json`. These tools and SDK
checkouts remain local and retain upstream licences. MinHook source hashes
follow. See [BUILDING](../docs/BUILDING.md) for the complete source-build route
and locally owned game prerequisites.

## MinHook source pin

`third_party/minhook/` contains the exact source snapshot pinned below, with its
upstream [licence](minhook/LICENSE.txt). Upstream project:
[TsudaKageyu/minhook](https://github.com/TsudaKageyu/minhook).
The vendored README lists v1.3.4 while its CMake metadata declares 1.3.3;
the pins identify the supplied bytes without asserting an upstream tag. The
adapter's CMake directly compiles the four x64 C sources, rather than invoking
the vendored CMake project. These SHA256s pin its x64 sources, included headers,
license and version/provenance files:

Retain the supplied MinHook and bundled HDE copyright/license notices. The curated public export
includes these pinned source files and their licence. Verify their hashes above;
an upstream tag with a similar version label does not establish identical bytes.
A mismatch requires a reviewed dependency update.
